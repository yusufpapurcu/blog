Hello! I'm Yusuf. I try to put my writings into here as posts. I hope it droves me to write/do more things.

#### About me
I'm a software engineer living in **Porto/Portugal** currently. I'm 19 years old, even though I'm young I have couple of years of experience in software engineering. If you're interested here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusufpapurcu/). Drop me a connection!

Other than this fancy hobby (which unfortunately turned into a job) I love watching anime and reading manga. Not a diehard Japanese culture addict but I started to learn the language really long time ago and now I can understand when someone greets me xd.

#### About this blog
I don't know what to write but I think it will be mainly about programming. Let's see how long this one will stay alive xd
